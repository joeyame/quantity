# The Quantity Programming Language
A high-performance statically typed programming language meant for
scientific computation, simulation, and system control.

Quickly write highly performant code with complete confidence of
its correctness!

```qty
qty length meters|meter|m
qty area meters^2|meter^2|m^2 (length*length)

rect_area = area|length l, length w| {
    l*w
}

print rect_area( 12m, 2m )
```
