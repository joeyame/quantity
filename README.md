# The Quantity Programming Language
A type-driven, mid-level programming language meant for scientific computation and simulation

The main design points driving the creation of this programming language are:

| Concept    | Description                                                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Explicit   | Quantity code shall have no undefined behavior                   |
| Beautiful  | Quantity code shall be easy to read and understand               |
| Functional | Quantity code shall be purely functional yet organized           |
| Expressive | Quantity code shall require minimal boilerplate to be productive |
