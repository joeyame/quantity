# The Quantity Programming Language
A type-driven, mid-level programming language meant for scientific computation, mathematics, and simulation

*All links on this page will redirect you to the official documentation for this project*

Every decision made in the design of this language is based off the following axioms:
1. Behavior is defined
3. Boilerplate is wrong
8. Limitations are few
4. Values have meaning
2. Speed is implicit
6. Functionality is composed
7. Organization is important
9. Documentation is powerful
