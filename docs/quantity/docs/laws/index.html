<p>The following laws are the major influencing factors of all decisions made during the
development of <code>Quantity</code>. They offer insight as to why the language is the way
that it is.</p>
<h2 id="1--law-of-reality"><a href="#1--law-of-reality">1. üß™ Law of Reality</a></h2>
<p>The Law of Reality states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúAll values in <code>Quantity</code> represent reality‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the major uses for programming languages is solving real problems and making
our lives easier. Therefore, it is a <em>real problem</em> that every other language
forces us to strip all meaning from the values in our code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, if you have a variable to store a distance of 30 feet, you have no way of
attaching feet to that numeric value. Instead, you will have to either remember that the
value is in feet, you‚Äôll have to leave a comment there that might get missed later, or
you‚Äôll have to include the unit of the variable in its name. Now, imagine that you would
like the user to input a distance of their choosing. Do you force them to input feet too?
What if they have their value in meters? Do you code a separate conversion function for
every single possible unit? This very small example is quickly turning into a big problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>Quantity</code> allows your code to represent reality in ways no other language has achieved so
far. It does so through its innovative Quantity and Unit system. Units are treated as
secondary types to the value, allowing you to write generic functions operating on quantities
themselves. These systems allow you to focus more on reality and less on implementation.</p>
<h2 id="2--law-of-amenity"><a href="#2--law-of-amenity">2. üéÅ Law of Amenity</a></h2>
<p>The Law of Amenity states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWorking with <code>Quantity</code> is a blessing, not a chore‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team managing this project is focused on providing the best tooling, writing, and overall
developer experience there is. Our inspiration for this is first and foremost Rust, which comes
with built-in code documentation, testing, package management, language server, and very helpful
error messages <em>(until you get deep into generic Hell)</em>.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make <code>Quantity</code> at least as easy to work with as Rust. We will ideally provide
some features for academic professionals that will make this language especially useful to them.
One such idea that is still in the early phases of development is embedding <code>Quantity</code> code into
Markdown and LaTEX documents - then running the code almost as a preprocessor on itself, like PHP.</p>
<p>Such a feature would allow you to create a simulation, write a paper, and present the results all
in one single document! No other language has ever come close to such a workflow, but this is
one of the driving goals of <code>Quantity</code>.</p>
<h2 id="3--law-of-brevity"><a href="#3--law-of-brevity">3. üìù Law of Brevity</a></h2>
<p>The Law of Brevity states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúEvery character in <code>Quantity</code> code is important and
productive‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many languages nowadays, like Rust, have mechanics in place to help minimize
the amount of boilerplate that you write. Macros provide an interface for the language to
write itself, allowing you to focus on the things that are actually important. This is a
good and inspiring thing to <code>Quantity</code>, but it does not go far enough.</p>
<p>Every single unnecessary character is a waste of your time. This language is
designed to eliminate every character possible without negatively
affecting the clarity of your code. Every single decision in its design has been centered
around minimizing the amount of work you must do as a developer.</p>
<h2 id="4--law-of-tensity"><a href="#4--law-of-tensity">4. ü™¢ Law of Tensity</a></h2>
<p>The Law of Tensity states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúAll expressions of <code>Quantity</code> code are comprehensively defined‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With <code>Quantity</code>, there is no undefined behavior that you need to be aware of
when targeting different systems. One of the great disadvantages of C and C++
are the wide range of almost standard-practice techniques that are not technically
defined uses of the language. Compilers on different platforms might handle
certain blocks of code differently. How can you have confidence in your work
with that fact looming on your mind?</p>
<p>In this language - every behavior is fully defined behavior. This allows you to approach
problems with the confidence you need to support all platforms.</p>
<h2 id="5--law-of-clarity"><a href="#5--law-of-clarity">5. ‚òÄÔ∏è Law of Clarity</a></h2>
<p>The Law of Clarity states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúCode written in <code>Quantity</code> explicitly describes itself‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Brevity is a major component of the design of <code>Quantity</code>, it is
worthless if the end result is not clear. Every aspect of this language is
designed to be self-explanatory and clear. Once you learn the basics, you
will never have to repeat a search again.</p>
<h2 id="6--law-of-duality"><a href="#6--law-of-duality">6. ‚òØÔ∏è Law of Duality</a></h2>
<p>The Law of Duality states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúA <code>Quantity</code> program is both compilable and interpretable‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many languages require a trade-off between convenience and runtime
performance. Higher-level languages like Julia and Python both support
JIT-compilation but that comes at the cost of constant re-compilations.
Lower-level languages like Rust have great performance that comes at the
cost of a longer development process.</p>
<p><code>Quantity</code> bridges the gap between the two groups of languages by natively
supporting interpretation and compilation - sometimes within the same process!</p>
<p>This support is on a level that no other language has reached before. Rust gets
close with its extensive macro system that is pretty much its own language, but
imagine writing macros for your code in the same language as the code itself!
This is within the realm of possibility for this language.</p>
<h2 id="7--law-of-rabbity"><a href="#7--law-of-rabbity">7. üêá Law of Rabbity</a></h2>
<p>The Law of Rabbity states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúCode written in <code>Quantity</code> is effortlessly fast‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being a language whose main focus is computation and simulation, it will be
unreasonable for it to lack the performance of lower-level languages like C
or Fortran. <code>Quantity's</code> development is heavily inspired to deliver this
performance while keeping the language extremely easy to use.</p>
<p>The final fulfillment of the Rabbity law is that the mascot for this language
is the Desert Cottontail - an adorable rabbit that is native to the place where
this language was made.</p>
